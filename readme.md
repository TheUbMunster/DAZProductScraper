The purpose of this program is to create a local copy of *publicly available* information about products you
own, to make the process of "window shopping" your assets easier. Daz's product dashboard is notoriously poor
at letting you easily view your own products, nor does it make it easy to find what you're looking for. If you
wish to tag your own products with your own/new information to make searching for what you need, on your terms,
this program is for you.

It composites thumbnails of the storefront's image collection, as well as copies the product description to allow for
easy searching.
